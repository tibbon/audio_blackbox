# Next Steps for macOS Menu Bar Integration

We've set up the foundation for a macOS menu bar application, but there are still several issues to resolve:

## Current Progress
- Created placeholder macOS menu bar implementation that allows the app to compile
- Set up image placeholders for the menu bar status icons
- Defined the overall architecture for the menu bar integration

## Remaining Tasks

1. **Fix AudioProcessor Trait Implementation**
   - Update CpalAudioProcessor and MockAudioProcessor to implement the new methods:
     - `start_recording`
     - `stop_recording` 
     - `is_recording`
   - Update the return type of `finalize` to match the trait definition

2. **Fix Config Implementation**
   - Update config.rs to handle the new constant types (bool, u64, f32 instead of strings)
   - Remove the parse() calls on native types

3. **Complete macOS Menu Bar Implementation**
   - Resolve the objc runtime binding issues in src/macos/menu_bar.rs
   - Fix thread safety issues with proper synchronization
   - Test menu bar functionality with recording status updates

## Building and Running

For now, you can build and test the basic functionality:

```bash
# Build the project
cargo build

# Run without menu bar
cargo run

# Run with menu bar (macOS only)
cargo run -- --menu-bar
```

## Future Improvements

- Add proper error handling for menu bar operations
- Add settings menu to configure the application
- Add support for custom menu bar icons
