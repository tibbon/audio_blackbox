# Next Steps for BlackBox Audio Recorder

This document outlines the next steps and priorities for the BlackBox Audio Recorder project.

## Recently Completed

1. **Fixed Output Mode Validation**
   - Added proper validation of output modes in the audio processor
   - Implemented a new `setup_standard_mode` for mono/stereo recordings
   - Updated configuration file comments to clearly document valid options
   - Changed default output mode from "wav" to "single" to match code expectations
   - Added better error messages that clearly indicate valid options

2. **Implemented Thread-Safe Menu Bar Architecture**
   - Created a thread-safe design using a message passing architecture
   - Separated UI code (Cocoa/Objective-C) into a dedicated UI thread
   - Added proper communication channels between threads
   - Resolved issues with Objective-C objects being sent between threads
   - Simplified the menu bar implementation with a cleaner design

## High Priority

1. **Implement Safe Cocoa/AppKit Wrapper**
   - Create a safe Rust wrapper around NSApplication and NSMenu
   - Implement proper exception handling for Objective-C/Cocoa calls
   - Develop a safe event handling system for menu interactions
   - Add proper cleanup and resource management
   - Create tests for the wrapper to ensure stability

2. **Finalize Menu Bar Implementation**
   - Build proper menu interface using the safe wrapper
   - Add proper icons and visual feedback
   - Implement support for more menu options
   - Build and test on various macOS versions

3. **Resolve CFRunLoop Method Call Issues**
   - Fix the `run_in_mode` method call on `CFRunLoop` objects
   - Ensure proper syntax for calling Core Foundation methods

4. **Address Cargo-Clippy Warnings**
   - Add the `cargo-clippy` feature to the Cargo.toml file
   - Update the code to use the proper feature flags

## Medium Priority

1. **Improve Error Handling**
   - Add better error handling for audio device initialization
   - Implement graceful recovery from audio device errors
   - Add more detailed error messages for menu bar initialization failures

2. **Enhance User Interface**
   - Create better icons for the menu bar
   - Add more menu options for configuration
   - Implement a status indicator for recording quality

3. **Add Configuration Options**
   - Allow configuration of audio format (WAV, MP3, etc.)
   - Add options for audio quality settings
   - Implement configuration persistence

## Low Priority

1. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Optimize audio processing for lower CPU usage
   - Reduce memory footprint during long recordings
   - Implement more efficient file writing

2. **Additional Features**
   - Add support for scheduled recordings
   - Implement audio visualization
   - Add support for audio effects or filters

3. **Cross-Platform Support**
   - Investigate menu bar/system tray implementations for Linux and Windows
   - Create platform-specific UI components for each supported OS

## Technical Debt

1. **Code Refactoring**
   - Separate UI code from audio processing logic
   - Improve module organization
   - Add more comprehensive documentation

2. **Testing**
   - Add unit tests for core functionality
   - Implement integration tests for the full application
   - Add automated UI tests for the menu bar interface

3. **Build System**
   - Improve the build process for creating application bundles
   - Add CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and releases
   - Create installer packages for easy distribution
